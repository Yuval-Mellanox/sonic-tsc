This is not going to break anything, and if anything, would allow the stock kernel to boot up on one additional device."

        "comment_body": "Sorry for the delay in replying.  I am in the silicon valley, or power was knocked out all week.\n\n \n\nI\u2019ve reviewed the change, it looks simple and effective, it should work.\n\n \n\nA couple of notes, regarding the performance impact\u2026\n\n \n\n\nNo significant time difference is seen related to EEPROM read after adding the current changes. Below stats were taken for a 100G CMIS based\n\n\ntransceiver with making it as optoe3 v/s optoe1\n\n\nTest stats (average time taken after 3 dumps)\n\n\nTime to dump first 4096B from EEPROM with transceiver as optoe3 - 914ms\n\n\nTime to dump first 4096B from EEPROM with transceiver as optoe1 - 911ms\n\n \n\nIf this test was done as a single 4K read, then there was only one read of the ID byte, which would be small compared to the full 4K read.  The impacted case is short reads of pages beyond page 0.  For CMIS devices, page 11 might be read often to check the \u201cChannel state, flags and monitors\u201d.  This is where we find all the alarms and warnings, per channel, for things like TxLOS, Tx CDR LOL, Tx Power High/Low, Tx Bias Current High/Low, etc.  This page might be typically read regularly by health monitoring software, for every device in the switch.  Try running 100 reads of page 11 (EEPROM bytes 1536-1663) to see if the overhead is higher.\n\n \n\nNote that there should also be a performance impact on QSFP (non-CMIS) devices.  These will also fall into the case that reads the ID register.  Keep in mind that with the patch, optoe3 devices do not suffer the performance impact, so it is appropriate to compare optoe3 vs optoe1 CMIS device performance.  QSFP (non-CMIS) devices will always be impacted by this patch, so the only way to compare performance for true optoe1 devices is between the patched and unpatched drivers.  However\u2026  For QSFP (non-CMIS) devices, there is not much interesting data beyond page 0.  For reads between offset 0 and offset 255, the page checking does not happen.  So there is no performance penalty (CMIS or non_CMIS) for data in the first 256 bytes.  Bottom Line:  In the real world, there should be VERY little accesses beyond byte 255 on QSFP (non-CMIS) devices, so the performance impact on those devices doesn\u2019t really matter.  Don\u2019t bother measuring it.\n\n \n\nSo\u2026  I would like to see the optoe3 vs optoe1 performance impact on a large number of small reads of page 11, rather than on a single read of a large block.\n\n \n\nDon\n\n \n\nFrom: Paul Menzel ***@***.*** \nSent: Monday, March 13, 2023 2:10 PM\nTo: sonic-net/sonic-linux-kernel ***@***.***>\nCc: donboll ***@***.***>; Mention ***@***.***>\nSubject: Re: [sonic-net/sonic-linux-kernel] Read ID register for optoe1 to find pageable bit in optoe driver (PR #308)\n\n \n\n@donboll <https://github.com/donboll> , could you please review the series?\n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub <https://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-linux-kernel/pull/308#issuecomment-1466960821> , or unsubscribe <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AD6VCJ4ZDUV2PAX3CQAFQETW36EKHANCNFSM6AAAAAAVW7OKEQ> .\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.Message ID: ***@***.***>\n\n"

The changes that the new script is making results in modifying files that are tracked in the repo. This means after a build (or even attempted build, in case of a build failure), the git repo's state will be dirty (because there are changes to tracked files).\r\n2. There's nothing undoing these changes after the build is done, meaning if someone switches from a secure boot to non-secure boot environment variable settings, then they'll need to reset the git repo as well.\r\n3. Considering all that is being done is setting some configs (one of which takes in user input), having it be done in `manage-config` makes more sense IMO. `kconfig-secure-boot-inclusions` and `kconfig-secure-boot-exclusions` can be created as well to store the config changes that don't depend on user input."

The purpose of creating `kconfig-secure-boot-inclusions` and `kconfig-secure-boot-exclusions` is to have just the static secure boot configs (i.e. everything except `CONFIG_SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS`) in a regular plain-text file, which will then be read in by `manage-config` (similar to how it's reading in `kconfig-inclusions` and `kconfig-exclusions`) and apply the secure boot configs if some argument is passed in. `manage-config` would also separately set `CONFIG_SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS` based on the argument value passed in.\r\n\r\nFor the kernel build from sonic-buildimage and controlling the configuration, whether the kernel will get rebuilt after it's been already built once depends on the `DEP_FLAGS` for the kernel build:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sonic-net/sonic-buildimage/blob/5e4a866e3311f859b9fe479aa379b38521de9725/rules/linux-kernel.dep#L6-L7\r\n\r\nThis variable would need to be updated to include the config variable that would be specified in sonic-buildimage to control whether secure boot is enabled and what certificate is used. That way, in a build with caching enabled, if someone switches between having secure boot enabled or disabled, or even different certificate paths, then the kernel will get rebuilt (I don't recall if this is fully checked or not in a build with caching disabled)."
